I never forget curtain blowing breeze. I still remember way made tilt head. I remember facial expression I saw it. I didn't know happened movie over, I find life way. It didn't bother me. The unfairness ultimate rejection innocent character strikes sadly real. I loved faces, way camera dwelt upon them. The camera gazed set unfocused eyes daydreamer. Borderline real way movies aren't. It exactly lack explanation, color, sharpness made enter consciousness like thief night. I love movie. Someday I it."

I loved special effects, fantastic places trial-aspect flashback method telling story.Several years later I read book interesting I could definitely see Swift trying say, I think it's perfect book social commentary, story movie better. It makes sense one long adventure Gulliver return voyage making profit selling tiny Lilliput sheep whatever.It's much arresting everyone thinks he's crazy sheep DO make cameo anyway. As side note, I saw Laputa I stunned. It looks much like Kingdom Zeal Chrono Trigger video game (1995) also made like mini-series even more.I saw 4 years ago, realized I still enjoyed much. Really high quality stuff began excellent run Sweeps mini-series NBC followed solid Merlin interesting Alice Wonderland."
6,"Good old Jess Franco! The always-reliable choice director case you're looking undemanding sleaze, shameless exploitation 200% gratuitousness. Jess really surpassed utterly trashy piece jungle ""adventure"". Let's face it, film basically excuse ravishingly hot (and underage��) actress Katja Bienert parade around topless. It's actually rather disturbing thought innocent 16-year-old girl walk around film set naked front whole crew particularly gazing eyes pervert Franco! And wasn't even first time, since duo previously already made ""Linda"" together. Anyways, case wondered: YES, ""Diamonds Kilimanjaro"" plot, albeit imbecilic one. During opening sequences plane, carrying aboard wealthy Scottish guy girl child, crash amidst African tribe vegetarian cannibals. I say vegetarian never one point film much even attempt consume human flesh. The obnoxious Scot declares Great White Leader girl grows become beautiful scarcely dressed White Goddess. Several years later expedition reaches middle jungle get girl back civilization �_ even importantly - steal tribe's legendary diamonds. This could compelling action-packed adventure movie, Jess Franco obviously couldn't bothered. Why shoot jungle chase sequences bloody cannibalistic rites easily aim camera hot young chick sitting naked tree? Most jungle settings simply appear filmed someone's garden there's massive amount clumsily edited National Geographic wildlife footage order fill gaps continuity. The back DVD describes ""Diamonds Kilimanjaro"" ingenious, feminist adult orientated version Tarzan. Yeah right, put sentence Katja Bienert's character swings one tree another using couple times."

No, nothing original. Yes, it's little group teenagers going woods camp, drink sex. Yes, get killed one one maniac. And know what? It's magic! It's one best experiences I watching slasher movie. The places it's shot wonderful. You see mountains, waterfalls, rockies. It's amazing. It takes long time (except opening scene) killer starts killing, I didn't care! It enjoyable watch enough care. What I mean is, won't sitting waiting murders start every thing happens enjoyable beauty film itself. The ending bit weird, I won't tell anything it. You'll know I mean. Another thing I enjoyed: care characters. They're bunch jerks spend time bitching other. Sure, pure stereotypes usual slasher characters but, there's something special them. Anyway, it's great horror movie I hope pretty good time watching I really did!"

11,"I think Samuel Goldwyn trying accomplish two things film. First film homage Jascha Heifetz, considered best violin virtuoso past century. Secondly brought screen Dead End kids film title seeing sign Warner Brothers, trying create second gang appealing urchins. Though film good certainly demand kids film reteamed another feature.

His stepfather, Arthur Hohl, breaks violin late father gave young Reynolds threatens send reform school feeble protests mother Marjorie Main.Young Reynolds happens stumble onto music school run old music maestro himself, Walter Brennan daughter Andrea Leeds. They take in, financial problems lot creditors led Porter Hall.This film mostly seen today it's chance classical music lovers see hear Jascha Heifetz gather solution one way another everybody's problems. Joel McCrea film also, rather colorless part Andrea Leeds boyfriend. Besides Heifetz, one thing film touch on, albeit gingerly topic child abuse battered spouses. Arthur Hohl one mean man Marjorie Main clearly much battered wife.The kids cast well, Reynolds, Tommy Kelly, Terry Kilburn young girl name Jacqueline Nash grew performed Gale Sherwood, nightclub partner Nelson Eddy.

12,"Joseph Conrad's timeless novel, Heart Darkness, depicted 1994 movie. I read Conrad's novel, I must say, even though I prefer novel itself, movie great depiction. The set costume designs brought Conrad's novel life screen followed Marlow's journey. The acting also brought characters life mannerisms, voices, personalities. If read novel, I recommend also view movie. If read novel, however, movie may harder follow. Conrad's Heart Darkness full action, emotion, information made movie little hour half long. Therefore, read novel, plot movie may seem cluttered follow. Overall I gave movie seven ten. The basic plot novel brought forth screen great sets, costumes, acting. Nothing replace Joseph Conrad's original work however."
13,"Sadly, movie potential willing cast, everything poorly thought poorly executed. I don't think I've ever seen film every scene falls flat loud thud, here. Also, I don't think I've ever seen ""stoner"" sex comedy didn't provide least one laugh, vortex pain provided nothing groans misery. The last time I stunned un-funny comedy awful ""Big Momma's House."" Scene scene, movies turn brain jelly. Silly stupid sometimes funny, here, silly stupid used torture device viewer.

17,"I see film intending do. Unfortunately never quite completes deal. The ""reality crime"" aspect works fine shots first rate. In fact quite scenes incredibly evocative moody sort way. Notably silhouette detective talking beat woman, scene detectives going garbage, father tying flies. On occasion scenes bog much dialog. Instead showing viewer writer treats much like book. But real problem lies editing. The story flow. It fails make whole sum parts. In end confused actually happening. Those like sort detective movie like follow along, piecing together puzzle time lead characters do. With poor editing difficult nearly impossible this."

My expectations weren't high begin with, turned cornier I expected. I thought might bad started, soon name competition--The Golden Whisk--came began changing mind. It went downhill there. The thing I like movie, snickering it's absurd plot dialogue, watching cook. However, movie pastry chefs, minimal scenes actually baked anything. I would recommend watching cooking channel instead movie. You get see food prepared, dodge pathetic one-liners. However, enjoy corny love stories, sometimes fun, go ahead watch."

28,"Here film clearly banks marketed exotica audiences unfamiliar subject matter.An attempted hybrid fiction document, ""Kadosh"" clumsily falls chairs. As documentary, one hand, neither accurate insightful. To realize sloppy handling detail, one needs go opening scene quite obvious ultra-orthodox protagonist know even much properly put t'filin. More generally, tedious rote-style presentation details (in case Jewish ultra-orthodox ritual) role manual, good documentary; latter provide organizing principle (a gestalt, will) viewer, may emerge better understanding viewed. This clearly happen here, ultra-orthodox ritual made even enigmatic. The director seems done decent job explaining verbally film's release campaign; cinematically, however, severe case stuttering. As fiction-feature, hand, suffers flatness character, simplicity plot bluntness message. At points I felt I watching cartoon. (e.g. wedding night consummation scene - without going detail angles, positions dimensions ... well, technically could possibly realistic portrayal human sex, savage may be.)There subtleties film. The clever manipulation hints, stimulating viewer's imagination thought taking active part cinematic text, I believe mark good feature, completely absent. On contrary: watching movie I felt, times, force-fed already chewed-up way-too-obvious content. It is, indeed, director Gitai put interview, architectural ""shifting objects space"", coloring scenes appropriate emotions called advancing plot appropriate predictable track; spark, creative, duende-like dark, inarticulable spark (let's forget ""Kadosh"" supposedly tragedy), casts two-dimensional screen spell turns extension viewers world, missing without trace. Perhaps work visual-engineer, perhaps unsophisticated ideologue; definitely true filmmaker. What I saw passion-play animated issues rather flesh-blood-and-complexities real people. The acting, large, failed transcend directorial flatness idea forced (at times even tortured) film. One notable, though relatively minor, exception mikve-lady mother, played excellent seasoned Lea Koenig.It takes strict adherence winning formula (namely, serving exotica, plus heart wrenching yet simple melodrama, plus popular agenda, preferably politically correct) tantalize interest buds. The bottom line here, said, considerable portion movie I simply bored. In spite novel, perhaps even pioneering achievement using ultra-orthodox neighborhood movie set, Mr. Gitai crew deserve praise, I found ""Kadosh"" way Nadosh (Hebrew ""trite"")."

For us actually fly, flight hours boredom punctuated moments terror. I wouldn't wanted see flight shortened all.

I think red one depicted DVD ""The Great Train Robbery Other Primary Works"" best them. The dance hypnotic much like piece amazing performance art.

The case portrayed plausible, probably happened many times many children world. This film critical changing public opinion order get rid laws protect harmful people like Senior Social Worker ""Broken Promise"".I strongly recommend Broken Promise. It especially appropriate viewing trainee social workers, psychiatrists, psychologists, doctors, caregiving professions. It lesson avoidance taken heart.-----------In terms acting ""Broken Promise."" Melissa Michaelsen plays superb part Patty Clawson. Especially films believability critical. If viewer identify character Patty, whole message film would jeopardy. It's unfortunate Melissa doesn't still act films today, performance ""Broken Promise"" shows exceptional talent."

Not must-see, recommended like actors."
34,"The Railway Children, least 1970 movie version written directed long-time British character actor, Lionel Jeffries, unmitigated...classic.

Then one night Christmas holidays two men appear doorstep, talk quietly father, take away.

As important players are, especially Dinah Sheridan mother, Agutter heart story. For me, Jenny Agutter's talent Lionel Jeffries' style restraint make movie memorable. The story's problems come serious doubt solved. And Jeffries give us expertly adapted directed movie, adds touches barely noticed charm us. This might include split second freeze frame two people talk; slow close-up small, yellow wildflower grass outside Bobbie's home, slow pull-back yellow oil lamp turned inside; realization delightful interior shot view green countryside look train station hill...all suddenly recall charming Edwardian hand-tinted drawings perfect by- gone time. Perhaps gentle story can't compete time kids need nowadays perfect Nintendo monster-splatting skills. I'm almost positive would never capture attention parents, especially weaned Batman Leone. Still, it's perfectly put together movie shouldn't forgotten. As aside, 19 years later story retold television program. This time, Jenny Agutter played mother."

Barbara Stanwyck making films many different studios (RKO, Paramount Selznick) time made THIS IS MY AFFAIR, Taylor MGM contract player appeared film loaned Fox--something studios occasionally era.The film interesting many real-life people roles film, though piece otherwise pure fiction. You'll see actors playing William McKinley, Teddy Roosevelt Admiral Dewey. I can't recall film McKinley Dewey character, though I remember Roosevelt THE WIND AND THE LION couple films. Three cheers seeing ""lesser President"" film major character! The film begins McKinley taking young lieutenant (Robert Taylor) aside asking special agent him--and telling one--not even Secret Service. That's President fears someone within agency tipping gang making long string robberies--all based inside information. So it's Taylor (who NOT known manly roles--especially stage career) pose thug find gang responsible AND inside man.However, two serious complications. First, able find gang members, one gang member's step-sister Stanwyck. Taylor finds he's fallen love must also duty turn authorities. Second, McKinley person knows truth, SERIOUS problems develop McKinley assassinated Taylor death row crimes!!! The film nice job creating story placing within historical context. While today people don't remember McKinley remember assassinated, film set interesting time period. The acting pretty decent, stars supported Victor McLaglen Brian Donlevy, though I must admit Donlevy's role pretty tame ordinary compared many film roles. Overall, it's interesting, well written sappy romance department. A good outing all."

One evening Goldwyn wife Frances dinner Heifetz wife, silent screen star Florence Vidor, Goldwyn proposed Heifetz star movie. After persuasion, Heifetz agreed, condition acting kept minimum. And movie, originally titled ""Music School"" born.The story rather stock: A streetwise boy (Gene Reynolds, best known producer ""M*A*S*H""), runs away home ends financially troubled music school run Professor Lawson (Walter Brennan). While attempting raise funds school, boy kids happen across Heifetz Carnegie Hall. After much ado, Heifetz ends appearing school concert sponsoring school. The story, predictable,is surprisingly well written, although film contains several minor gaffes different scenes patched together, obvious young cellist sent orchestra room errand seen sitting orchestra seconds later.What surprising good acting is. As customary studios then, studio surrounded inexperienced star veteran talent: Brennan, Joel McCrea, Andrea Leeds, Porter Hall, Marjorie Main (later Ma Pa Kettle fame), Arthur Hohl, Paul Harvey, Who's Who character actors. Actress Diana Lynn singer/actress Kaye Connor made (uncredited) debuts film, longtime Nelson Eddy singing partner Gale Sherwood (as Jacqueline Nash). Child veteran actors Reynolds, Walter Tetley Terry Kilburn also appear.Goldwyn hired Peter Meremblum Symphony, highly regarded youth orchestra Los Angeles Area, appear film. Most kids orchestra weren't actors, excellent musicians, good professionals (which many later became). Many kids orchestra went noteworthy careers: Kaye Connor Diana Lynn starred theater movies, Richard Berres producer director, Mitchell Lurie founded well-known music supply company, Elliott Rapaport went prominent cardiologist, Lewis Elias band leader, Thomas Facey conductor different symphonies, Channing Robbins prominent instructor Julliard School, sister Joyce Robbins instructor witn SUNY Stonybrook, many kids orchestra pursued musical careers major symphony orchestras.While Heifetz's acting kept minimum, salary wasn't. He commanded $70,000 seven weeks. When scenes re-shot later date, got additional $50,000 another four weeks. What thankfully wasn't kept minimum musical output. Composer Alfred Neumann (who Meremblum Orchestra conductor) handled scoring. Heifetz performs ""Introductionne Rondo Capriccioso"" Camille Saint-Saens, arrangement Manuel Ponce's ""Estrellita"" (with off-screen Teddy Saidenberg accompanying), Dinicu's devilishly difficult ""Hora Staccato"" (from Vitaphone recording, Emanuel Bay piano), excerpt Tchaikovsky's ""Melody"", excerpt arranged violin solo Tchaikovsky's well-known ""Adante Cantabile"" opus 11 string quartet (played opening credits beginning movie), final movement Felix Mendelssohn-Barthody's E Minor Violin Concerto. During performances, many closeups Heifetz's performing, including close shots fingering bowing, something would value violinists desiring study technique.The Meremblum orchestra also shines here, performing arias ""Caro Nome"" Verdi ""Casta Diva"" Bellini, (both Sherwood singing ), arrangement overture Rossini's ""Barber Seville"", short excerpt Mozart's ""Eine Kleine Nachtmusik"", previously-mentioned Mendelssohn concerto (with Heifetz). Diana Lynn heard background one scene, performing part Chopin's Nocturne B-flat Minor, five year old Mary Ruth performs Chopin's popular ""Minute"" Waltz.All all, excellent movie. AMC showed regularly early 1992. I haven't seen television recent years, copies difficult obtain. If chance, I highly recommend view movie."

Later, man comes home, betrayals scheming occurred--leading almost one hour fifteen minutes non-stop killing.If looking Chinese martial arts film much plot, probably skip movie, practically non-stop action practically plot character development--even compared martial arts films. I would estimate 80-90% film fight scenes--endless reasonably well made fight scenes using knives. Again again, fight scenes! If want film body count perhaps running hundreds people slashed, kicked, slashed, film you. The problem end film literally people left kill film really lost interest!!

Her high pitched, screechy baby voice gets annoying second starts talking. All acting bad, really Kathy Ireland far worst. The plot also terrible kind mix Alice Wonderland Mad Max. Wanda Saknussemm (Ireland) gets letter saying father, left long time ago, fell bottomless pit Africa, goes find him, falls underground world full strange Australian accented people. It's one corniest movie you'll ever see, terrible lines throughout. It's annoying effects movie uses character development. Kathy Ireland nerd won't anything go anywhere. She flies Africa....wow, development! She drops glasses doesn't need them. Why dropping one's glasses represent becoming nerd. It represent descent blindness. It's stupid.

His vast knowledge filmmaking, ability dissect scene film, winning Academy Award obscure category seemed give credibility average independent film director. When mentioned one classes finished directing film called ""Full Ride"" post-production stages, interest piqued. However, would last I would ever hear film project. Until last week...Last week, I saw TV listing ""Full Ride"" going showing WB network. This immediately raised red flag, I can't help associate WB teensploitation shows Dawson's Creek, Charmed, etc. PLUS, fact Full Ride going released straight TV wasn't flattering itself. But, nevertheless, I set aside time sat watch former film teacher's creation.After two hours passed end credits began roll, I thought long hard I seen. What I seen typical WB-quality show stretched length two hours. In fact, almost seemed movie made sole intent showing WB network. Critiquing movie basically like critiquing typical WB show.Where begin? The characters shallow, story cliche every sense word, scenes completely contrived, character development forced unbelievable. This movie screams `unoriginal.'The main character, Matt Sabo, hot shot wrong side tracks (literally) plays solid high school football fullback, fizzles life crime. He offered chance full ride scholarship instead going jail. Obviously, without much choice, agrees play football all-star football team, excepted among peers poor team spirit bad attitude.Then comes love interest. Of course! Where would predictable fanfare without love interest? She comes form Amy Lear (played beautiful Meredith Monroe). She actually likable character, opposed ever-so-abrasive Matt Sabo, almost applaud rejects first. But, course, inevitable comes pass.

This movie uninspired version `Varsity Blues' `Summer Catch.' And that's saying much. There's hardly comedy save characters shallow care about. So left? Not whole lot.What I disliked movie much unflattering picture Hoeger painted Nebraska film. It seems like trying capture essence rural Nebraska teenage life small towns, approach stereotypical shallow. The characters' high hopes making `the big city' actions take greatly exaggerated, cements stereotype Nebraskans bunch hicks living farm communities. I unsure whether Hoeger's intentions good trying put home state spotlight, I think ended shameful product. If Hoeger wanted portray Nebraska favorable light, taken note two Alexander Payne. While Payne simply chooses use Nebraska backdrop films, Hoeger integrates plot Full Ride becomes entangled awareness he's shooting, ends churning superficial garbage would seem come outsider. If Hoeger actually lived here, you'd think he'd know better that.All all, I completely disappointed Hoeger's first big film, I hope next time combine knowledge little bit originality create something different thought-provoking."

The '40's produced mindlessly fun matin��e films high art, fans agree classic era Gothic horror films ended 1945 'House Dracula', bumped around Abbott & Costello comedies, officially dead 50's coming Atomic Age.So it's strange perhaps one Universal's finest Gothics made '50s!

And there's Romeo & Juliet-style fake death leads film's prologue....The plot clich�� world-view black white. But it's still incredibly entertaining, director Nathan Juran making every scene pile atmosphere seem fresh new. several plot-holes, too. Why Ronald attempt leave castle early? And never solve mystery happened friends even though it's obvious, doesn't know gives up, seemed sure earlier. Weird.All actors great. Despite rude upperclassman, Richard Greene makes Burton one likable protagonists I've ever seen horror film.

When reveals burnt eye, laughs maniacally, truly scary. Lon Chaney Jr. also great mute henchman Gargon.But best performance undeniably Boris Karloff mysterious physician Dr. Meissen. He little screen time first, steals every scene in. It performance creepy, sad, mysterious ultimately, heroic.

''Till Clouds Roll By,"" ""The Miracle Bells"" don't really count, however, considering first sing magnificent ""Ol' Man River,"" latter he's half bad-only picture pathetic. My favorite records, radio shows, TV shows, movies concerning Sinatra change virtually every day-everything taking different connotation viewing occasionally seeming best thing ever occasionally worst cycle comes around again, couple things beyond comparison. When comes movies, ""The Man Golden Arm"" heads list. Everybody knows anything Sinatra knows thought best-ever performance; Oscar-nominated; first serious look drug addiction; etc.,etc. The jazz score unforgettable, Kim Novak's likable despite ludicrous accent, Eleanor Parker annoying waaaay dramatic, turtle-like Arnold Stang amusing first time embarrassing every time out, Darren McGavin makes wonderfully slimy drug dealer, sets unconvincing - first glance seems peculiar mixed bag tossed together great Otto Preminger off-center charm. Then come Sinatra. Like everything else life - music - reports acting alway divided half. Directors like Fred Zinnemann, Frank Capra, Billy Wilder, Stanley Kramer, Martin Scorsese, Peter Bogdanovich, Otto Preminger, agreed Sinatra worked hard films singing, he'd among greatest actors world - THE greatest. Humphrey Bogart even said,""This guy natural acting talent I've ever seen."" Not bad man never took acting lesson life, time producing discography would make ""the greatest singer 20th Century,"" almost scenes one take.

There's real definition often makes hard figure whether you're really enjoying performance spellbound, quality display makes movie. Sinatra downright riveting, real, intense - transcending decades thousands paper-doll pop stars something called quality. Like not, one-man show character actors hanging around background.

Well...RedNeck one two positive things going on, part; it's dull, lifeless film ridiculous pointless. The plot simply focuses two criminals (Nero Savalas) kidnap young kid (Oliver). The twist tale kid realises he'd fun gets accepted 'gang'. Telly Savalas Franco Nero two actors proved carry film numerous occasions, memorable moments film - although really wrong reasons.

The misogyny, cultural insensitivity, almost laughable macho-ism films genre used major comic effect.

It especially bothered see Simon portrayed way... He's supposed smart, serious nerd acts ""straight man"" Alvin's crazy antics. But he's pretty much carbon copy Alvin. One joke film even implies Simon *thinks* he's smart really isn't... honestly I never heard Chipmunks seeing film, I would agreed.In opinion, film another obvious cash-grab, I'm little sorry even made. The fact it's ""kid's"" movie doesn't excuse flaws... To excuse stupid movie degrades classic franchise it's children insulting children, kid would deserve something intelligent film."

In four stories lack empathy leads disaster:1. The crematory-worker shows realistic empathy dead animals say goodbye them. In crematory-room dealing death fire it's almost like cheerful game him. The seriousness death fire emphasized father boy accordingly, ignorance pushes button leads disaster injures father severely.Possible lesson: The importance showing young adequate emotions.

Here ice cold Nazi-sadism becomes obvious physical violence. It gives possible background somewhat plausible explanation actions young ""scin-head""-nazists behavior oppressing others. Possible lesson? : Can Nazism take birth pervert home?Can hideous consequence ignoring empathy family life, long run, room given sadistic Nazism ?Very seldom movie contains much.

Norman whatever name tried, would appear, witty biting lines chose fell really short.After words asked anyone saw ending coming people ""yea"", called liars.

But I digress--Drew Barrymore delightful, usual, David Arquette even enjoyable, I usually can't stomach him, STUPID AT&T commercials!

229,"'The Mill Floss' one lesser novels Mary Ann Evans, wrote male pseudonym George Eliot. I tried read dull turgid novel years ago, unable finish it. I'll review film version solely merits, I don't know faithfully follows original novel.The film's opening credits printed Old English typeface suggests mediaeval period, it's poor choice film 19th-century setting. (On hand, halfway film, see close-up shot handbill advertising estate auction. This handbill set authentic Victorian type fonts, looks *very* convincing.) Most film extremely convincing depiction architecture clothing early 19th-century England. The precise location film's story never disclosed, - judging actors' accents - I'd place somewhere Cotswolds, perhaps Warwickshire.The plot, it, involves mill changes hands couple times (over couple decades) two rival families, one wealthy one working-class. I disagree another IMDb reviewer claims James Mason small role film. Mason largest central role drama, scion wealthier family. As spoilt petulant Tom Tulliver, Mason darkly brooding impetuous. His performance belongs better film: made want see 'Wuthering Heights' recast Mason Heathcliff.As multi-generational saga (something George Eliot much better 'Middlemarch'), several main roles film split among two actors apiece: child actors prologue, adults main narrative. The prologue film features well-written scene, establishing Tom Tulliver wilful bully-ragging early age, young Philip Wakeham decent thoughtful. Through hard labour, Philip earned halfpenny: Tom tries bully away him, unwilling take coin brute force: wants Philip *give* him. All child actors movie, male female, talented attractive. Unfortunately, children speak dialogue posh plummy-voiced accents utterly unlike accents actors actresses play roles adults. This discrepancy calls attention staginess material. Regrettably, none later scenes good prologue.The climax features crowd labourers rainstorm, much better paced photographed earlier scenes. But modern viewers (in Britain, least) longer take sort material seriously. By now, practically every British comedian done ""trouble t' mill, squire"" comedy routine, parodying precisely subject matter, I difficulty watching movie straight face.The character actress Martita Hunt good small role, opening credits (in Old English typeface) misspell forename 'Marita'. I'll rate dull movie 3 points 10: one point apiece James Mason's performance, early scene children, authentic Victorian typesetting auctioneer's handbill."

Not say bad movie, fact it's good attempt portraying innermost emotions - dilemma, sorrow, love.., esp it's director's debut (read somewhere, true?).

Through simple short dialogs, director tries relate simple guy's life, copes news illness laughing away every time. Oh ya laughter kinda cute first gradually gets me, deep hearty roar gentle man! I must say, I didn't feel impact readers felt, fact I drawn trivial scenarios like spitting watermelon seeds sis clearly shows they're comfortable other, granny came back another shot - kinda melancholic, thoughtful gesture writing procedures dad - hmm predictable.. Don't misunderstood I'm action-lover, independent films cup tea! Perhaps I really high expectation watching many deep films stronger imagery. Some Asian films worth watch: Tony Takitani (depicts loneliness) Wayward Cloud (only 1 dialog) My Sassy Girl (I like it!) 4.30 (loneliness well) 15 (gangsters lives local setting) Before sunrise Before sunset (I mention even though Asian films.

While Emily Edward check local hotel John begins question locals Uncle Tom's death - say committed suicide, unwilling talk. Puzzled John comes theory - Uncle Tom alive well, hiding nearby bushes.If occasional lines dialog used ease heavy atmospheric tone Modern Love could easily mistaken Sokurov film. Shot 16mm camera washed-out color scheme strangely evocative Russian director's reflective forays human agony. Perhaps isn't coincidence Moscow International Film Festival Modern Love premiere.Looking surface unique collage intoxicating visuals however reveals slightly different picture - Sokurov's films tend remain painfully intimate, point intentionally detach main protagonists surrounding environment blurring everything large splash director's preferred yellow, Modern Love much feeds Australian countryside. John's gradual psychological transformation dependent story progresses becomes obvious nature integral part Frayne's vision.In Sokurov's The Second Circle young man returns Russian countryside bury deceased father. In shack old man lived everything covered dust. He gathers old clothes scattered around places body father coffin. Then bids goodbye buries it. The rest film prolonged reflection collapse Soviet system, loneliness dissatisfaction many left dealing with.In Modern Love, somewhat ironically, love nowhere seen. On contrary pain, loneliness, dissatisfaction ""modernity"" suddenly invade John's life. Unlike The Second Circle however main protagonist opportunity re-embrace modern life. His wife son await him, yet, walks away. Slowly surely present begins disintegrate weight somewhat confusing past.I doubt Frayne intended Modern Love strikingly similar Sokurov The Second Circle. Yet, pacing, particular puzzling framing, precisely transforms film near meditative experience - difficult enormously brittle approach deconstructing human psychology two directors mastered perfection.Mark Constable delivers top-notch performance John adding even greater depth highly challenging character. His facial expressions outstanding. Both Victoria Hill William Traeger match perfectly performances pic's tense visual style."

259,"I finally watched third film Mehta's trilogy: ""Fire"". To begin, I'd say ""Water"" unquestionable masterpiece, levels. Fire comes next Earth close behind order quality. Fire: much going film I'll need viewings drink in. The writing superb, script creating friction starts entire process ""heat"" beginning end really erupt fire, conflicts moving complete rupture relationships. Mehta one brave lady: sees clear eye much jaundiced, false repressive great society came from. India rapidly changing days much economic change. That met ferocious opposition making ""Water"" script cleared, shows still many taboo subjects Indian people less cannot look squarely face, cannot examine discuss them. Worse, someone like Mehta courage hold mirror issues, faces death threats. So, much India thinks pluralistic, tolerant society, facts always so. Whereas ""Earth"" merely historical setting carnage civil war Indian independence, Fire Water pointing personal, social religious issues, I say considered strongly (in negative sense) open artistic dialog still many years away. As I write ""Water"" scheduled actually shown India later year. I'll believe I see it. Fire confronts similar sexual emotional conundrum I saw ""A price rubies"". Whether it's arranged marriages (which used like among Jews 150 years ago, like among many modern Indians), risk bad match forced upon men women; or, plain loveless marriages..... However, real issue. Mehta clearly impatient totally rigid religious attitudes either keep widows misery (Water) else keep women enslaved loveless marriages (Fire). I expert regarding either secular Hindu laws concerning divorce. The film seems imply stigma (of divorce)is almost bad sad marriage. In case Mehta's film moving, powerful attempt sexual discourse holds modern Indian relationships probing scrutiny. That three films made felt India unwarranted attack culture sounds like predictable clamor repressive mindset. Mehta forcing issues looked matter much flack. I admire work cannot highly recommend films enough. Superb, disturbing, provocative, taboo shattering."

If nothing else, provided alternative comedy something alternative to. I found sad though likes Ben Elton took Benny Hill. Well, family oriented comedy vanished screens, left us? Take look latest T.V. schedules. All soaps reality dross. The comedies left aimed teenagers, meaning jam packed swearing, bodily function jokes, explicit sexual references.

The young hero sympathetic provides good protagonist root for. The romance dimension remains undeveloped, though, bit disappointing. Otherwise great movie.My rating: 8 10."

While watching movie, seen twice already, I realized far fandom goes. Probably far enough rate movie 1/10, people miraculously did.The movie attempts parody many movies series, notably Cast Away, Lost Jurassic Park. Unfortunately, fails miserably level.

Hurt keeps making excuses family needs most, Ellen assumes he's affair. Meanwhile she's given desk work spend time craft activities mother's ""cult"" group The Minnies, also learning mother isn't weak first assumed.Without giving much away, ""One True Thing"" masterpiece character study.

Hurt also convincing father carries secret isn't revealed closing moments. But Renee Zellweger steals movie. Forget ""Chicago"", ""Cold Mountain"", ""Bridget Jones's Diary"" whatever else you've seen rent movie. She remarkable it. Working within character's bitter resentment understanding parents, Zellweger manages realistic portrayal young woman fighting keep lip she's screaming inside."
277,"I'm astounded dismayed number reviewers site get point Black Snake Moan. It's black/white relationships old/young relationships, though I think director Craig Brewer deliberately threw elements tweak imagined taboos. It's sexual abuse sex addiction, though Christina Ricci's character, Rae, typifies those. It's folk religion black community, though religion plays large role. It's love story, though one, two happy couples end. And it's certainly south, ""everything hotter,"" though it's set south it's undeniably hot; holy smokes, even tag-line writers didn't get point.Black Snake Moan parable Mississippi Delta Blues; feels them, writes them, plays them, they're playing about, heals them.It's though film producers sat blank slate asked, ""Ok, going help people understand Blues really about, would look like?"" So set rural south. Then dream two characters, one whose wife left live best friend, goes war badly abused girl sleeps everybody town. Then, throw grizzled worldliness touched little folk religion (they know Jesus wants lives, though respect Him, know can't give Him that), violence men women, lots lots steamy sexual images, including -- ready go top? -- black man sleeveless undershirt holding half-naked white girl captive end 40 lb chain. Fill authentic delta blues sounds, make genuine blues picker, use music main healing element plot, slap clips blues-man Son House ends, Voila -- modern parable Blues about. Even film's climax character conflict, whole town dancing steamy dances hot, raunchy blues.Of course, there's bit dilemma here. Rae (Ricci) destroyed uncontrollable lust, healed Lazarus' (Jackson's) homey religion steadfastness (and don't forget chain.) But then, we're shown restored Rae dancing raunchily blues end. Is expression restored, healthy life force, trashy behavior ruined first place? Brewer wants ways, blues really sex violence, mention depression. I suppose would say blues gives healthy expression (sex violence) without unleashing either. I doubts.Not first time, Samuel L Jackson plays well forget we're watching Samuel L Jackson; man unbelievably good. He even picks tunes film, playing authentic, dirty, hot. Christina Ricci isn't usually good, either. Granted, half job done Costume That Wasn't There slinky figure, she's marvelous combination cynical lust, rebellion, vulnerability; bravo her, she's arrived. I impressed country preacher, John Cothran, Jr. I check database assure he's professional actor genuine country minister.Parents need aware they're getting kids bring one home. The language pretty far charts, first half-hour full graphic sex, women violated dozen ways course film (Lazarus means well decent, honestly, chaining woman radiator?) Plus, Ricci spends half movie dressed sex; you've got teenage boys, they'll licking screen halfway film. I don't recommend kids age. Adults only, please.That said, Black Snake Moan informative accurate blues, folk religion, sexual abuse, tells tale that's redemptive lots ways. It's unorthodox, well worth time. And, goodness, sound track hot."

Honestly, I used think autopsy done examine condition particular organs ascertain cause death. Now I know dead bodies severed, raped humiliated, intestines ripped apart, brains retrieved head, stuffed abdomen mixed guts, body stitched back washed - nothing personal.

She never walked anywhere, marched; far often came abrupt stop mark. She also lacked really emotional facial expression intonation. She either pensive look cute smile; rarely emotions apparent. When tries appear dramatic begins line looking away 'then' turns eyes fellow actor. Or alternatively begins line looking opposite looks away. Both annoying done replacement true emotion.

346,"Now shark movies I've seen, one takes cake! The plot movie good, excitement factor sort took nosedive afterwards. Antonio Sobato, Jr. excellent role son seeks shark killed father. A megaldon one biggest sharks dangerous one well. The view shark indeed scary angles, effects blur, scenes little weak places. With mini-sub's weapons there, would take whole school sharks there. It great son would get exact revenge monstrosity, although would indeed cost life well. Like say revenge it's price, worth it? That answer could go on, movie major letdown. The beginning fine, end, went like Titanic. 1 OUT OF 5 STARS!"

There filmed instances Oyama actually this, although sometimes bulls seemed tethered Oyama getting years. Sonny Chiba portrays master conviction karate quite good. Chiba may best karate practitioner but, point time, certainly average. As whole movie good, much better martial art films drama department. I always wondered it's well known. Possibly realistic depictions martial arts. People shown getting tired hurt unlike 99% action film hero limitless fountain energy blow instantly dispatches opponent death.

In honesty, good things along bad things movie. Unfortunately, bad things far outweigh good. Good: The overall plot mildly interesting. The music overall pretty good. Several songs (when could hear them) actually pretty cool. The musical issues I were: #1) first suspense scene sort quiet instrumental (it really seemed take away suspense), #2) song played lead characters went outdoor party friend's house #3) songs good quiet, especially heavy metal song playing background Danny Trejo hung man (sounded like pretty cool song, ripped across scene Danny Trejo got froggy). Now completely bad stuff: The script atrocious. I mean, HORRIBLE. I've seen smoother dialogue Star Wars movie. Advice writer part-time writer full-time movie buff: When write dialogue, ask yourself, ""Is something people would actually say?"" Honestly, script laughable. I want slam acting, kind writing, it's hard know talent not. The mildly interesting plot seriously hampered crappy dialogue. I know low-budget, words don't cost money - good script, even semi-competent actors pull off. This movie didn't seem either, hopefully director get second shot making better film."

359,"I watched I saw couple good reviews this, I expecting least half-way cheesy movie. Toybox doesn't even deliver that. There many problems flick, I don't even know start, I list couple main issues (Once again, spoiler warning. Just read them, it'll save trouble watching later).One, movie starts with, often mentions, mythical folklore Celeste Noir (A witch, main character claims reincarnation of), mid-folker (or something like that, evil man big smile cuts people open hooks sells innards pies). I liked that, cute concept, anything pies simply enjoyable. But watch movie it's idiot girl boyfriend (And deal him? Was psychic? Did powers? Why keep seeing visions even called 'Witch' didn't notice??), meeting insane family. Not really insane, argue lot. That's movie is, arguing, barely touch supposed myth ever except couple confusing scenes can't make heads tails of.In one scene, Berenice (The main witch-related character) wanders sort ritual candle light. It seemed rather important, absolutely NOTHING happened it, wasted time.And hell guy dog? You see walking towards house start movie evil red-eyed dog, finally gets gets killed? What hell?? Was mid-folker? Was dog possessed? Did someone kill dog? They never really showed that. Also, scene involving Vicar completely pointless served weakly explain lame ending. It like interesting character ideas went nowhere! The boyfriend, obviously sort powers never explains them. The grandmother, appeared also sort witch powers, never used them. The Vicar, who...OK, never mind, really point existence all. And Berenice stupid amulet. Could really magic, use reflect light blind people? This complete waste time, reason I give two stars a) Berenice kinda cute, b) It mentioned pies. Save money renting dear god don't even think buying it, unless wasting money new fad."

362,"I'd picked one time time rental store, wondering I give shot. Today I broke gave whirl, I probably shouldn't have.While writer/director give film respectable effort, fell far short engaging. The characters, wanted feel them, didn't enough development depth get truly involved them. Sara's sexual outbursts got tiring-- fast. I don't mind sex films, I don't mind bitchy characters, ""bad"" girl doesn't mean you're prone excitedly ask people random they'd like sexual favors. By time happened characters revealed, I bored, ready fast-forward climax, end, anything exciting... nothing delivered. The things folks story eventually inform seems forced unrealistic, wasn't played quite right. If they'd thrown bit anguish there, I might interested. This suspense/drama film, stuck title ""Jon Good's Wife"" rather whole ""red right hand"" horror film-like cover. Hell... suspense, period.Either way... watch rainy day late night there's nothing television. Though isn't great I'd hoped, I would go infomercials."

For instance, second young Latino guy showed knew would really nice guy looked like gangbanger. Matt Dillon's character played million times, cop hardened years would see light degree end movie. The predictability hardly ended characters. A phenomenal cast wasted weak script. The morals story PC max. There clever twists nearly enough. The dialouge embarrassing times.

The basic scenario Air Force pilot shot `Middle Eastern' country. The US government drags feet recovering him, leading Pilot's son (Doug Masters) attempt rescue mission.The problem I movie depicts US Air Force one colossal joke. In movie you'll find Doug friends air base manage secure two F-16's, munitions, fuel, Intel mission, on. Security base seems joke. Nobody seems problem sixteen-year-old kid fully qualified pilot F-16!If wasn't enough, would think producers would least attempt get munitions right, since people like see things `blow up'. Not so! Several times movie, Doug fires AIM-9 Missiles ground targets. AIM stands `Air Intercept Missile', meaning weapon used strike targets AIR. He also fires 15-20 missiles, maximum F-16 hold 6 AIM-9's. The movie also lacks continuity. You'll see aircraft configured one set munitions, next scene, totally different munitions package. Also, 20MM doesn't completely destroy anything touches! An F-16 hold 500 rounds 20MM, it's mostly used self-defense.I could go forever plot holes, flaws, outright wrong information movie, I won't bore you. If you're mood see good Air Force movie, choices rather slim. Most military movies deal either Army, Navy Marines. Until Hollywood come Air Force movie lines `Saving Private Ryan' `A Few Good Men', we'll forced watch movies like `Iron Eagle' series."

The cast certainly portrayed roles well. It way movie written way characters written benchmark truly sick mind.I know I never, ever watch another movie written directed Jennifer Chambers Lynch. She sick, twisted, foul-mouthed, foul-thinking deviant. She looks, speaks sounds like biker chick brain fried drugs, spent 20 years hard time. You clearly see kind person watching DVD special features section ""Surveillance: The Watched Watching."" You see hear yourself. She every bit bad I envisioned writing movie.I'm shocked bad language, although director certainly talks like sailor. This goes far beyond simple bad language; worse p0rn film. The level implied sado-violence perversion incorporates every character writes genre even illegal p0rn standards. This perverse, disturbing thinking clearly apparent personality things says. Another reviewer found description I seeking. This snuff film.Be sure listen narration deleted scenes alternate ending. This director/writer truly sick person. I can't believe anyone would put charge movie, much less pay it. You assured I never, ever watch another movie affiliated with. In thousands movies I watched collected, couple directors writers merited kind boycott. She offensive beyond anyone I ever seen connected filming movie before. There bad directors writers, none could compare sick, twisted mind.When I saw movie, one murder rampage another. Once got past hotel murder... sick cops shooting brutalizing drivers kicks... vacation family bad parents (who business presence children)... followed drug addicts.... movie proceeded (even more) twisted, deviant serial killers.As I saw serial killers reveal themselves, I began wonder kind truly sick mind wrote movie. Those actual thoughts I watched movie. I fully intended find writer sick mind... writer seriously needs committed long-term psychiatric treatment. To surprise, turned director. When I saw heard say DVD, I realized assessment writer right nose. On DVD, indeed sick, twisted person I envisioned writing disturbing film.While little girl, (Stephanie) Ryan Simpkins, truly stole show... I can't believe real-life parents would tolerated sick, foul-mouthed, director anywhere near daughter.This movie disturbing, sick, offensive, twisted director-writer needs serious treatment mental facility.As far ending movie goes... alternate ending, outcome horrific ordeal. There point benefit film story flow film death character. I'm stunned studio actually distributed movie. The trailer completely misleading. The reason movie got audience due clever wordsmithing creative depiction trailer. That trailer representative movie see.Other child... every character movie sick, murderous, twisted, perverse, violent sex freak characters mirrored mind writer-director created them. But watch carefully, even parents vacationing family; sick cops taking pot shots; serial killers posing alternate roles; cops station; even station dispatcher... every single one character roles incorporated sexually, twisted, violent pervert. I'm sure actors watching talk filming movie Canadian town Special Features section DVD.This writer-director personal mental deviation matter writes, every character role contains carbon copy stamps. The character deviant tendencies child. Watch closely see every character. Then listen director-writer talk DVD Special Features section understand I'm telling mental state psychological issues. She wouldn't tolerated many decent homes Hollywood film making family.Fortunately, Jennifer Chambers Lynch much filmography... less handful things. Since carbon copies disturbing traits character roles, I don't think we'll see many movies written directed unless dad, director David Lynch helps out.

The British girl thought found likable quality main idiot, end somehow shocked turned jackass. The hot chick particular purpose hot, principal lackey served somehow move almost non-existent plot forward. I loved almost teachers show young, I ask think back high school days remember teachers . . . look like that? Or go high school middle-aged people teaching it? That high school everyone else went to. The show lacked form research goes schools. In public schools, principals power higher fire teachers, school board does, every episode I watched principal made threats fire teachers. Think back history class . . . . . think history class, ever see incredibly hot British chick teach American History class? No. Did ever see teacher's lounge huge could actually play basketball in? No.Teachers could great show actually based form reality. What makes teaching funny stories get interaction students, teachers find funny deal students day day out. The overemphasis lives outside teaching made another four camera sitcom unrealistic people unrealistic environment saying unrealistic lines, I'm sorry, I didn't buy it. The show could modeled currently successful sitcoms used single-camera format, centered around teacher's relationships students other.It gets star trying star hot chick (she really hot).In end, failed sitcom go history hacks attempt understand profession.

In opinion journey mind gives beautiful images things really matter long distracting. In fact, story pretty good.We start Catherine Deane (Jennifer Lopez) mind catatonic boy. How works exactly really matter, looks lot like virtual reality. She scientist including Henry West (Dylan Baker) Miriam Kent (Marianne Jean-Baptiste) believe method might work. Catherine enters mind boy speaks there, world completely created boy. She hopes let things end give results.The real story then. A serial killer named Carl (Vincent D'Onofrio) dumped body one victims. FBI Agents Ramsey (Jake Weber) Novak (Vince Vaughn) case. Another girl (Tara Subkoff) disappears time, forensic research dumped body, Carl traced captured. Two problems occur. 1. Carl went coma; sick long time. 2. His house house last kidnapped victim place. In way part story pretty standard.Things get interesting again. To find girl is, Catherine go Carl's mind. This dangerous lot reasons. In short: Carl unknown territory, schizophrenic serial killer. If Catherine starts believing Carl's mind real world mind convince body; could die mind Carl. A tape last victim killed, fate girl twenty hours, makes sure Catherine try get location Carl's mind.It journey sick mind makes film worth watching. Director Tarsem Singh, music videos this, way goes back music videos. Every room imaginative world another short clip exists beautiful sometimes haunting images. For visual style felt completely new, way 'Three Kings' new visual style one year earlier. If something like make like film, 'The Cell' disappoint. But fans thriller horror genre like film anyway. The story itself, without great fantasy world, good enough that. I think little open minded, course events (yet) possible real world. Still, entertaining film nice ideas looks terrific."

I finally got around seeing Apocalypse Now Redux flaws taken care of. Redux makes movie outright masterpiece, certainly among top 100 films ever made. Brando's performance seems full complete, perhaps rather less mysterious, much profound. Martin Sheen brilliant heart one best acting ensembles ever assembled. It's great spot young Harrison Ford, Scott Glenn, etc. early screen performances suggest fine actors eventually recognized as.

He gets away it, finds way subtly rationalise it. Quite frightening, negative message, suggestion many youth disconnected right twrong simply make rules go along, serving good ill.

Joining ""Lethal Weapon"" star Glenn Close (""The Big Chill""), Paul Scofield (""A Man For All Seasons""), Alan Bates, Ian Holm, Michael Maloney (who would cast Roderigo opposite Kenneth Branagh Laurence Fishburne Oliver Parker's ""Othello"" (see review Olivier's ""stage"" version tragedy, though starred it) Branagh would cast Laertes HIS 3-hour version ""Hamlet"" (a proper homage Sir Laurence Olivier classic version play; see review one well) 5 years later), Nathaniel Parker (who would cast Cassio brother's version ""Othello"" 4 years later) Helena Bonham-Carter, would cast ""Mary Shelley's Frankenstein"" 4 years later. Zeffirelli intended movie homage Sir Laurence Olivier (who died 2 years prior movie) works pretty well, part. What I slightly uncomfortable Zeffirelli's misplacing lot lines one scene, gives one Hamlet's lines Ghost. Also, Helena Bonham-Carter DID NOT convince Ophelia. She dull unreal, whereas Jean Simmons (who immortalized role Olivier's version) Kate Winslet (who acceptable job Kenneth Branagh's uncut, epic revisionist reworking ""Hamlet"") good role, Jean Simmons BEST Ophelia ever, that's nominated Best Actress 1948 (she didn't win-what shame). Ian Holm said lines quickly, slowly I expected to, scene him, Laertes Ophelia. But again, I'm used Felix Aylmer Richard Briers' interpretations role I think better jobs Holm respective versions ""Hamlet"" (both done great directors, actors, text-editors, producers AND stars versions Bard's work) Polonius. The rest cast, however, excellent. The scene Hamlet confronts mother well done, Olivier Branagh heightened scene better lengths create even emotional intensity suspense scene required. I recommend version pass time, it's ideal teaching tool 12th-grade English teachers (I recommend showing Olivier's version first, Branagh's finally version). Despite film's ""PG"" rating, really nothing objectionable movie. Only play called for. The Best Versions Of ""Hamlet"" Are: #1 Sir Laurence Olivier Kenneth Branagh. Both good I can't decide one best. See reviews versions information. #2 Franco Zeffirelli. This one alright. It started alright scene play, should've progressed actual beginning play, guard cries ""Who's there?"" ""Nay, answer me. Stand unfold yourself!!"" That scene scares hell you're sitting quietly then-bam!!, almost jump skin. In short, scene sets tone rest play. HUGE blunder Zeffirelli's part omit scene. It also misplaced lot lines (and cut others I think should've put in), line Hamlet says Ophelia ""Get thee nunnery, wouldst thou breeder sinners?""; line supposed occurred THAT scene, NOT placed film (after ""To Be Or Not To Be"" soliloquy. This version struggles cutting much little excellent piece literature. Kenneth Branagh would remedy 5 years later uncut version tragedy, making HIS version fitting homage Sir Laurence Olivier, several actors (aside him) performed ""Hamlet"" stage/or film many times different occasions. However, Zeffirelli's take ""Hamlet"" IS faithful play THAT's I looking for. The setup final act duel Olivier Branagh's versions, denouement Branagh's version violent denouement previous two faithful versions (more line play; Olivier toned down...and worked equally well) stuck closely play, Branagh throwing harmless touches own...to good effect. This version Not Rated."

The directing seems pretentious. The scenes ""oh-so-mature"" neighbour-girl misplace. And generally lines plot weaker average episode. Then scene debated whether sack trumpeter (who falsely accused murder) pure horror, really stupid.Some applause given ""prelude"" however.

I don't mean isn't good; I mean it's extraordinarily bad -- sometimes laughably so, mostly it's boring. Its strongest appeal comes attractive people naked US network TV allow, it's tease substance, nymphs backup characters can't justify several hours bad TV.There two basic problems cast can't overcome. First, script *awful*. Yes, making changes Hercules myth (which certainly single monolithic story first place) traditional, version relentlessly dull much frequently dumb (and sometimes downright head-shakingly peculiar), terrible pacing, bits borrowed (and several parts seemingly belonging different films), truly awful dialogue. The dialogue frequently unbearably bad, fact, point feel embarrassed actors. Sean Astin, apparently typecast second-banana, seems especially burdened one awful line another. There's consistency tone atmosphere little cohesion plot.Second, special effects really bad. REALLY bad. There's occasionally decent bit CGI, mostly, again, feel really embarrassed behalf cast. I idea budget project was, sure looks like crap compared ""Clash Titans"" even ""Hercules: The Legendary Journeys"" doesn't even compare favorably old Lou Ferrigno Italian 'spaghetti' Hercules movies. Just painfully miserable.There plenty problems -- story needlessly complex can't keep itself, Hercules isn't presented interesting character. Almost everyone doesn't European accent tries fake one kind, merely amateurish dated never really made sense first place: drama doesn't become better actors use British accents, all. But terrible script equally terrible effects sink whole thing right bat.In fairness, ""Hercules"" apparently intended four-hour miniseries truncated (for airing, anyway) three-hour TV movie. I don't know cut, it's possible edits made things worse. I don't think could make ""Hercules"" good adding it, doesn't mean continuity, say, hasn't suffered network edits. There's way I'll watch USA version see, though."

Her boyfriend seems like pretty nice guy, she's also pursued rich guy Ricardo Cortez. Well, marrying, turns ""nice guy"" thieving, womanizing weasel rich Cortez turns heck guy. By end film, Barbara simply enough, SANE woman would walk horrid marriage.In 1920s early 30s, Hollywood pretty much anything wanted films themes scenes would surprise many today--such nudity, adultery bad language. While TEN CENTS A DANCE isn't blatant example morality, theme never would allowed toughened Production Code created enforced starting 1934. In ways Code great--after all, parents didn't need worry kids saw films (such nudity BEN HUR, 1925). However, also tended sanitize movies far much--and way particular film could made approved tends glorify divorce--a serious no-no 1934 thereafter. This really shame, I don't think TEN CENTS A DANCE bad discuss this--especially since star (Barbara Stanwyck) married philandering thief. Even so, allowing film end divorcing marrying man twice divorced couldn't been.Overall, film interesting thought-provoking. Plus, well-paced suited relatively short run time.

The editing also annoying, MTV stylized. Another thing that's missing Tank Girl exciting adventure. The humor isn't much funny either.

It's probably reason people hesitate call movie first ever sound picture.The movie made William K.L. Dickson, assistant Thomas Edison ordered come way unite pictures sound. The answer provided Kinetophone, Kinetoscope (basicly large wooden box peephole it, people could watch moving images) cylinder phonograph inside it, sound. This first, know off, surviving movie-experiments feature technique. All later movies using technique shot silent movies sound effects recorded later separately. So Kinephone attempt synchronize sound images attempt images accompanied sound. In cases, people could even choose three sound cylinders, featuring 3 different orchestral performances accompany images. Only 45 Kinetophones ever made could hardly call Kinephone success. Also experiment, focus went cinema techniques, mainly regarding movie-projectors.So experiment obviously become success, also since took 30 years first movies sound made commercially released.

461,"Visconti's Death Venice qualifies one beautiful films ever made. While watching, acknowledge hands visionary genius. Endlessly opulent Death Venice surely is; important ways, it's unsatisfying film. Thomas Mann writes contempt distance von Aschenbach's literary career output; imperious manner, layer-upon-layer programmed, self-conscious behavior. When Tadzio appears obsession arises, it's evident Aschenbach hasn't slightest idea beneath Gilded-Age trappings carefully lived life. In fact, upon seeing Tadzio, 'Solitary,' Mann sometimes calls him, splits two. Aschenbach No. 1 absorbs sight beautiful 14-year old boy, attempts intellectually process giddy jolt blood pressure would work art - 'divine' work art. But Aschenbach No. 2, emerges stalker takes control of, replaces, rational Aschenbach No. 1. Like original Aschenbach, sexual-doppelganger mortified make human contact object obsession - thus Tadzio remains far-off ideal. Thomas Mann mercy game. Every shred self knowledge comes strong late; excitement sexual flush great resist. That Venice gripped disease means nothing Aschenbach - except game higher stakes. When finally whispers beneath breath 'I love you,' knows lost, abyss awaits. Is filmable? Perhaps, Visconti creates visual feast impossible look away from. But errors: He Dirk Bogarde create Aschenbach sympathetic; Mann, again, not. Aschenbach's POV dominates film expected identify. But nowhere screen man torn apart within. Bogarde toggles sublimely controlled ridiculously temperamental ease - what's underneath? Bogard's reactive performance mooring. Mann writes character is, imagination, Dance Seven Veils, aware consequences freedom invites, yet unable, unwilling resist. Also, Visconti's screenplay creates character original - Alfred, friend Aschenbach's - dramatize Mann's discussion Art Artists. These scenes badly written disasters, actor portrays Alfred difficult watch. Also, Visconti's Aschenbach Gilded-Age Teutonic composer, I think works film; symphonies Mahler substitute Aschenbach's novels. Mahler's great music unfortunately badly recorded badly played. So Death Venice, Visconti hands us, complete success might been, purely visual experience power cannot denied. All students film, especially cinematography, want take look."

In addition, sound man (if one) must either newbie drunk sound amateurish. Even one first scenes kitchen (AWFUL acting btw) sound dialog pretty bad. For example, woman moved head speaking, could hear voice disappear come back. It sounded like tried correct post-production turning volume bit turns head. In addition, ongoing irritating buzzing sound either camera equipment sources kitchen. All squeakers first 5 minutes so.

They enjoy whole day together end day, shy one learns life usual routine monotony. The thing happens Albert De Santi.

Absolutely awful, I don't even know begin. I idea anyone given 2 stars I can't think one good thing say it. The plot basically, 7 people go unexplored cave, one reporter. no-one else knows there. When get cave, can't get get killed one one monster. There turns reason reporter. One characters past demons ex girlfriend drowns cave 2 years ago... seems relevance reason either, rubbish attempt character building I assume? Anyway, The monster turns guy wandered cave normal little kid lived life. This reason makes superhuman, able glow, see dark, take bullets, breathe underwater, 2 places insane strength (able move boulders, carry grown men dead weight, etc). In end scene 2 women left alive, wake naked, covered bit rug something. They find picture kid. The Monster bursts door, wrapped carpet sort animal skull head (says directors commentary crow's skull, would frekin biggest crow I seen life) quite literally goes ""Raaahhh"" like kiddie Halloween. I watching boyfriend point literally burst laughing. The guy sees picture kid flashback sitting tree face burnt getting wandering cave. That extent back story mutilates people leaves feeling bit cheated story. The monster kills one women brutally rapes one, cut end credits. I know rape scene designed shocking, woman made feel quite ill thing affected whole film. He could killed cut pieces ate would less horrific rape scene.There many things left unanswered end. Aside this, scenes minutes time black nothing else annoying constant nauseating camera angles it's upside can't see what's going wound much one point I almost turned off. An absolutely terrible film.

486,"Okay, I've read reviews movie, well comments left visitors site, feeling I get people wrote reviews really didn't like movie. That's I'm writing now-I represent minority because, I did. I admit, I went see movie I impressed Ryan Gosling's compelling abilities, projects part lately nothing less incredible. He amazing actor. That aside, I wanted see movie seemed intriguing me... why? Because it's whodunit know `whodunit' start, that's kind unusual.As plot goes, two teenage boys endeavour commit ""perfect crime"" believe twisted philosophy committing acts crime human beings truly free-the uninhibited, let's remember, guiltless, acting one's will. The relationship Richard Justin complex, hinted homosexuality, brilliantly acted Ryan Gosling Michael Pitt. Gosling manipulating, controlling smooth-talker, Pitt extremely book-smart, socially awkward outcast. Enter Sandra Bullock's character, seems people didn't particularly appreciate. I think people see executive producer automatically assume role actor self-glorification thing. I didn't see case here. Without ""Cassie's"" personal history ex-husband nearly killed her, who, surprisingly, shared similar traits Richard Hayward, never would pursued instincts Justin Richard. The case seemingly airtight Ray, unsuspecting school janitor friend boys. Even boys questioned near end movie neither Bullock partner much solid evidence fact lied knowing other, vomit Justin left sight. Therein lay genius movie philosophy boys trying prove act killing, guiltless acting `true freedom,' ended working Justin, ended conscience (and ended leaving part conscience body dump site). Without crucial piece evidence, almost ""murder numbers."" And readers puzzled title much I have, I looked found something done ""by numbers"" (such painting) suggests careful critical planning exacting. There's also song Sting called ""Murder By Numbers"", that's beside point. :)Many readers questioned necessity relationship Cassie partner, I think really meant show cynical manipulative become history. Like not, history play important role movie without it, would likely never followed instincts Justin Richard. Yes, bit cliche `women scorned, woman acting vendetta every facet life' plot, I think without depth Cassie's character another movie teenage killers, may gotten away it. There's movie there.And reader commented teenagers obviously didn't commit perfect crime police beginning, I remind reason purposely placed, totally traceable shoe prints. The boys wanted involved-it game. They confident committed perfect crime wanted see first hand difficulty investigators would uncovering think truth. What didn't expect Cassie Mayweather overactive case instinct working side. A little unbelievable? Maybe. But many crimes solved police officers followed instincts. However, MOVIE!I saw movie theatres three times, time revealed little me, I liked little more. The I watched it, I captivated frightened psychological depth Richard Hayward-there people really like this. My main complaint movie would Justin Richard's interactions little central (because, let's face it, lays intrigue entire film) main props go characterization-each character distinct interesting his/her way. It well acted, although I would given Ben Chaplin's character little depth work (he's good actor) maybe pared Bullock's character smidgen.I think everyone keep mind Hitchcock type thriller like basically tell ""whodunit"" beginning, poses big challenge writers keep attention audience end. I think quite well utilizing small plot twists throughout, slow revelation different character dynamics, lighting screen really emotionally charged performances young actors Ryan Gosling Michael Pitt. I think remove innate cynicism attempt see psychologically complex characters interactions are, may able look beyond apparent plot holes see real texture quality movie, characters brilliantly portrayed. Especially Richard Hayward. Not I'm biassed. :)"

On songs like ""Kashmir"" ""In The Evening"", Plant vocal boost old, yet, ""Whole Lotta Love"", returns one song.Overall, one best musical DVD's ever released, next great ""Beatles Anthology"" boxed set released earlier 2003. The sound, 5.1 DTS 5.1 Dolby Digital, like Beatles DVD, gives feeling on-stage performers, standing right next them, would feel Beatles DVD jamming studio.

It isn't worth 3.99 rental either you'll much less inclined truly hate film pay 12 bucks better per person plus concession purchases theater.In theater I watched AVPr exactly two laughs, girl sitting next me. Other total silence throughout. No ooohs, ""that bad ass!"", nothing. Imagine patient operating table given anesthetic. Now know you'll feel like theater opening scene AVPr.What budget movie? Like War Worlds, MI 3, f/x driven movies director seems far involved CGI people come developing characters plot. Spielberg tried failed several times, usually Tom Cruise. Sure movies make money they? War Worlds Minority Report budget pay decent script, Tom Cruise et al, SS still awful. I'm sure AVP wasted 90% budget CG choice hire actor would say yes even though casting agent would done better going supermarket picking actors random.There tension developed scene never close surprised. Who cares gets killed? We didn't know them, know happens lil aliens make corporeal exit, know blood acid. In Alien, Aliens, 3, Resurrection, even AVP directors make use fact Aliens think, hide lay traps. This director decided Ridley Scott, James Cameron, others idiots developing characters actually want see either live get killed. In installment never care lives dies, kid, parent, pregnant woman. The characters serve one purpose movie, die. The opening scenes establish fact movie going predictable joke. The character development scenes mix clich��s, bad humor, bad acting numb viewer point really don't care get killed long die never seen ways. But don't. The director tried make something different preceded Alien franchise succeeded discarding good parts first films, human protagonists, stealing rest recent sci-fi films.There one original use either Alien Pred characters. The Pred actually little trouble killing Aliens dozen even though last movie led us believe Pred revered Aliens deadly foe used killing one Rite Passage. The AlienPred never really developed fearsome creature. Its ability inject parasites host ripped several different movies recently probably Hellboy Samiel's dismembered tongue injected eggs Hellboy Doom mutated creatures would leave tongues behind speared victim's throat.Simply put aren't given reason care anything movie.

The trite scenes says misses wife came almost close touching, although **SPOILER** tacked scene end taken back wife needed lengthened, wasnt believable. And throughout film Vegas appears miss wife 2 3 times.The film became grotesquely unfunny plain old, well, grotesque, sex mentioned. Not, I add, shown screen. Tolly's gratuitous explanation sandwiches even slightly funny, made feel little bit ill. Also totally unneccisary inclusion character Jeremy picking nose, showing close bogey finger. Just picking nose would raised smile, pathetic character would made look low possible, showing snot close needed rank.One scene I think hilarious involving sex Vegas threesome. His blokish conversation second bloke highlighted fact threesomes arent always endless ecstasy. Not I'd know.....That's I say really. I end this, actually main critique film. This supposed revive British film industry. It 'Trainspotting' sure....it isn't even 'Love Actually' (you'd heart stone throw one), 3 million pounds really could put better project.

I don't blame writer/lead actress is. It's acting writing skills needed years mature could pull vanity project carry feature film. The writing characterization amateurish slapdash, dialog often barely ABC Afterschool Special standards. The cast sincerely gives best effort, acting general definitely head-and-shoulders abortions like ""Future War"" ""Space Mutiny"", aren't really professional level performances here, exception 'Big Joe' Estevez, hammy suitably intense.

Yes, he's big scary looking role, I hate guy actor. (In real life, I wish well hope financially comfortable).There little things I liked film.

574,"First off, I'am horror fan. But ""Tobe Hooper"" production (come on, man original Texas Chainsaw Poltergeist !!) standards, even fan. The acting bad all, characters unbelievable, leading ladies OK. The story something we've seen hundred times already, without surprising twist whatever. Never exciting intense, count special effects besides blood splashing up. The scary zombie kids white paled faces dark eyes it.. That might worked early 70's now. Director J.S. Cardone didn't good job keeping suspense, half way thru risk fall asleep. My vote based primarily leading acting, could easily called Children Of The Corn 8: From The Corn Fields Mines... Enough said.."

581,"First off, I've read comments director I'd like thank offering opinion. I've always wondered makers films lambasted MST3K felt works shredded (not mention Best Brains acquired rights). Rissi's comments make curious, however, much Sci-Fi could cut film make seem different (now I'm thinking I might rent NetFlix). Of course, I've never seen uncut, non-MST3K version film even seen MST3K, I never thought bad film something unwatchable (though I think pretty funny MST3K episode); certainly not, Pearl describes it, ""skin-peelinging awful""; seeing likes ""Future War"" ""Hobgoblins."" As far cutting film, it's done MST3K, least once. Case point: Joe Don Baker flick, Mitchell, subplot involving John Saxon's character cut MST3K version, yet Joel Bots comment Saxon's absence appearance beginning movie. If I may submit criticism MST3K, need cut film time considerations, fine, fair film cut (even film lousy Mitchell). Of course, criticism rather pointless show over, I think aspect show kind unfair. But anyway, it's case Soultaker, gets sympathies. Still, I maintain it's enjoyable MST3K episode though movie itself, even version that's ""hacked"" MST3K, near terrible. As final note, weird coincidence perhaps case Synchronicity, I happened watch The Hudsucker Proxy day Soultaker aired wouldn't know it, guy played Vivian Schelling's father bit part movie; one three credited roles, actually. I thought kind weird."

584,"Formulaic max. Neither title reflects serial's actual content, ""Fighting Nazis Morocco,"" (actually, Iverson ranch). The plot fill lulls fistfights. The packaging claims 40 'fistic encounters' 15 chapters. That's least three chapter! Aside seeing Duncan Renaldo cast Spanish accented Frenchman, watching much furniture overturned, smashed, thrown, burned blown serial really about. When protagonists start fighting, bet everything room it, too. So, kudos fight choreographer, real star serial! Two positive notes: characters sometimes lose hats fights, best all, girl side kick (often journalist, here) actually participating mayhem, mostly shooting killing bad guys. Yet come Linda Stirling killing main villain ""Manhunt Mystery Island"" (1945). On negative side, many jump way escapes-- slab falls, car goes cliff, speedboat explodes, building explodes, truck hits you, etc. etc.It claimed serial partially 'inspired' George Lucas make first Indiana Jones film, implied concept actual story serial's development.Rod Cameron 'shines' moving rock, role played films. Other watching furniture getting smashed, there's nothing really going here, compared serials fewer fights, story, better actors developed characters.I give 3 furniture smashing."
585,"About movie itself, ample comments. I wanted say something German version, I seen recently TV. It heavily cut. From 103 76 minutes! It usual bloody scenes cut German TV. I understand reasons that, movie something else. They cut ""gore-shots"" - cut entire sequences, sparing glimpses. Like: ""WE attack THEM"" - one 5 second shot explosions camp - protagonist running away.When assault island begins, isn't even possible anymore follow storyline. All cuts create something amounts string erratic, disconnected scenes don't make sense anymore.I could stand watch end spending 60 minutes nonsense.I think I would given original 7/10 The German version worth 1/10Get DVD (and check runtime first) forget it."

This disconnection repetition reflected annoying distracting commentary. It began reciting words one other. Short, meaningless sentences reciting none relevant interesting scientific ramblings. If something described, four five words would used, long, repetitive, circular, looping,...you're getting idea.Now could reflect confusion character, slowly becoming caught thoughts, rambling due lack food water. What actually cause totally switch voice closing stages movie I found I hadn't listening ramblings.A number times event occurs camera shows characters one reaction, seems somewhere confused thoughtful. There repeated fades scene scene, instance character sleeping fades black, fades back character sleeping again. Look, know character asleep, know time passed, please move on. Overall many atmospheric cuts long, hanging shots fill time.The acting bad, characters okay, exploited developed. When interacting truly cringeworthy moments. For example one asks hungry camera looks returns group shot, pause, look other, turn back camera say slowly ""No"". It raised snigger two. Their dialogue slow, glossy either missing altogether totally unnecessary, seemed middle ground dialogue hit spot on.However, good scenes, really hard find unless viewed isolation, almost looks like happened movie. The film looked series scenes complete story.Nowhere seen main storyline. The characters infected virus killing animals, one engineered them. We're told develops stages something dramatic, expect. What get characters eating loads together, throwing together, water pouring mouths unconvincing streams, fall asleep, phases happen really early movie. Then, say ""Good"" together asked are, that's it. That's virus done, nothing else happens.There could much done movie, much developed virus protecting manner harm. It could explored serious change characters infected took them, could developed characters, shown making decisions things connect back character shown flashbacks interviews.The ending isn't even confusing, intriguing thought provoking. It shows something happens that's it, although long, drawn style irritating voice it. I really struggled movie watched number Press members walk (including one famous TV critic leaving within first twenty minutes), I stayed, regretted lost time."

There also plot details don't work. For example, drag body onto beach urban area broad daylight, opposed night time? Why leave flat sheet body? Why would artist knew Joe character brief time decide leave ""everything"" (even wasn't much)? This sub-plot poorly developed make point work. For matter, even man invalid artist provide money gratuitous nude posing scenes? He could easily photographer, opera composer? For matter, someone rate apartment Opera House - particularly without clear connection Opera? The coincidences also obvious unclear unexplained. Why would guys take everything warehouse ""disappear."" If Tim 10 year old school mate town small Bangor, could Joe lose track 8 years, especially knew well enough one would recommend job.
